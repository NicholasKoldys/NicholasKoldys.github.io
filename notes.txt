<image>
    - be descriptive with ALT
    - dont include title - its not supported in some browsers
        - use fig caption instead.

if <img> is too small use picture to change srcset to a better sized or positioned picture

href - rel points to inside the same site

// Don't call getAttribute to see if an attribute exists, call hasAttribute instead.
//Prefer to loop through childNodes rather than using first/lastChild with next/previousSibling. But prefer hasChildNodes() to childNodes.length > 0. Similarly prefer document.getElementsByTagName(aTag).item(0) != null to document.getElementsByTagName(aTag).length > 0.

MOST IMPORTANT PART OF MY JOB IS TO WRITE CODE THAT OTHER PEOPLE CAN INHERIT AND UNDERSTAND, READ WELL - WORK WELL
Each routine is read and is expected
Allow the reader to exit early be POLITE
A FUNCTION SHOULD DO ONE THING - TRY TO FIT ON SCREEN?
Intellij - extractFunction to classes with variables - func cannot extract with 2 changed variables - the global variable can become a class variable.
comment if code cant explain itself - every comment is a failure / unfortunate necessity - they silently rott
Do not checkin commented code - it will be in source control
longscope variables need long names, shortscope should be short
Is there Any optical illusions? - should be a check before checkin
data is a noise word

Read code = where does your eye do a lot of work , where is it busy

HTML Specific Rules

Avoid title in img element.

Use very descriptive Alt in img element.

Aside means relating to the current viewed document.
    - not necessarily content

H2's follow H1's, H3's follow H2's.
    - Any derivation is incorrect.
    - Bad: "h2> Title 2  h4> Section Title"
    - However, if sperated by section tag, then the sections h1 is considered top heading.

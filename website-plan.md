# Website Plan Document

## Description

This document is by **NO** means the definitive plan for the website.  It is just meant to be a fun approach for journaling my ideas and the vision-direction for the website.  Please don't read this.

## Path to Success

- ### Step-1 - Something to Show
    - Put something out there already.  Enough Planning and studying and just get something out there and practice.

- ### Step-2 - Variable Content Architecture
    - The idea is to have a environment-variable like document serving as a spreadsheet to the entire website (content-doc).
    - The external content-doc will have locations paired with content, and will serve as a master-list of all the content.  Changes can easily be made in one place.
    - The vision involves creating a javascript framework for creating the website when needed.
    - The content will be pulled from the content-doc and dynamically allocated to its proper html structure.
    - The framework can easily be done in Node.js, however, I'd like to test my skills and practice with vanilla javascript.
    
- ### Step-3 - ... 

- ### Result - Profit !!!
